              <p>The calculator uses the widely-accepted calendar method based on the biological principle that ovulation typically occurs 14 days before your next period. This method is most accurate for women with regular cycles between 21-35 days. However, actual ovulation can vary by several days due to stress, illness, or other factors. For improved accuracy, consider combining this calculator with ovulation predictor kits (OPKs) or basal body temperature tracking. For complete details, see our <a href="/about/">About page</a>.</p>

              <p>Our ovulation calculator uses the calendar-based method, estimating ovulation at approximately 14 days before your next expected period. For women with regular cycles (21-35 days), this method provides a reliable estimate of the fertile window. However, individual variation is common -- ovulation can shift by 1-2 days even in regular cycles due to stress, travel, illness, or hormonal fluctuations. For the most accurate results, we recommend combining the calculator with ovulation predictor kits (OPKs) and <a href="/blog/basal-body-temperature-ovulation/">basal body temperature tracking</a>.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes, you can use the calculator with irregular periods, but keep in mind that the predictions will be less precise. The calculator bases its estimates on the cycle length you enter, so if your cycles vary significantly from month to month, the predicted ovulation date may not match your actual ovulation. For better accuracy with irregular cycles, try entering your average cycle length over the last 3-6 months, and consider supplementing with OPKs or cervical mucus monitoring. Our <a href="/blog/irregular-periods-and-ovulation/">Irregular Periods and Ovulation</a> guide covers detailed strategies for tracking fertility with variable cycle lengths. If your periods are consistently irregular, it may be worth discussing with a healthcare provider.</p>

              <p>General guidelines recommend seeing a fertility specialist if you are under 35 and have been trying to conceive for 12 months without success, or if you are 35 or older and have been trying for 6 months. You should also consult a doctor sooner if you experience very irregular or absent periods, extremely painful periods, a history of pelvic inflammatory disease or endometriosis, known hormonal conditions such as PCOS or thyroid disorders, or if your partner has known reproductive health concerns. Early evaluation can identify treatable causes and improve outcomes. Our article on <a href="/blog/when-to-see-fertility-specialist/">when to see a fertility specialist</a> provides a comprehensive breakdown of these guidelines, and organizations like <a href="https://resolve.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="external-link">RESOLVE</a> offer free support and resources for those navigating fertility challenges.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes, the calculator works the same way regardless of age—the underlying biology of ovulation timing relative to cycle length does not change. However, fertility naturally declines with age, particularly after 35, and cycle patterns may become less regular. The calculator can still help you identify your most fertile days, but women over 35 who are trying to conceive should consider consulting a <a href="/blog/when-to-see-fertility-specialist/">fertility specialist</a> after 6 months of trying. According to <a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/having-a-baby-after-age-35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="external-link">ACOG</a>, while fertility declines with age, many women over 35 conceive healthy pregnancies with or without assistance.</p>
