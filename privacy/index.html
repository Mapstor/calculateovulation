      <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Summary (Plain English)</h2>
        <p>We believe in being straightforward about privacy. Here's the short version:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>We don't collect your personal health data.</strong> The dates and cycle information you enter into our calculator are processed entirely in your web browser using JavaScript. This data never leaves your device and is never transmitted to our servers.</li>
          <li><strong>Calculations happen locally.</strong> When you use the ovulation calculator, all the math happens on your computer or phone. We have no access to your menstrual cycle dates, fertile window results, or any other calculation outputs.</li>
          <li><strong>Nothing is stored.</strong> When you close the browser tab, your calculator inputs disappear. We don't save your data, create profiles, or track your fertility information over time.</li>
          <li><strong>No account required.</strong> You can use all features of our calculator without signing up, logging in, or providing any personal information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The rest of this policy provides more detail about the limited data that may be collected through standard web hosting and analytics.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Information We Don't Collect</h2>
        <p>To be clear about what we do NOT collect or store:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No menstrual cycle data:</strong> Your last period date, cycle length, period duration, and any other information you enter into the calculator is not transmitted to us.</li>
          <li><strong>No fertility tracking:</strong> We don't track your ovulation dates, fertile windows, or pregnancy-related calculations.</li>
          <li><strong>No health information:</strong> We have no access to any health-related data you may enter or view on our site.</li>
          <li><strong>No accounts or profiles:</strong> We don't require registration and don't maintain user accounts or profiles.</li>
          <li><strong>No personal identifiers:</strong> We don't collect names, email addresses, or any personal information unless you voluntarily contact us.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your sensitive fertility and health information stays on your device and under your control.</p>

        <div class="info-banner">
          <strong>Important distinction:</strong> HIPAA only applies to healthcare providers and their business associates. Consumer websites and apps—including fertility trackers—are generally <strong>not</strong> covered by HIPAA. This means most fertility apps have fewer legal obligations to protect your health data than you might assume. Our approach of processing all data locally in your browser sidesteps this concern entirely.

        <h2>Information That May Be Collected</h2>
        <p>While we don't collect personal health data, some information may be collected through standard web technologies:</p>

        <h3>Analytics</h3>
        <p>We may use analytics services to understand how visitors use our site in aggregate. This typically includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pages visited and time spent on pages</li>
          <li>General geographic region (country or city level, not precise location)</li>

        <h3>Server Logs</h3>
        <p>Like most websites, our hosting provider may automatically collect standard server log information, including IP addresses, browser type, and pages requested. This is standard for web hosting and is used for security and troubleshooting purposes.</p>

        <h2>Reproductive Health Data: Why Privacy Matters</h2>
        <p>Fertility and reproductive health data is among the most sensitive personal information you can share. Unlike a browsing history or a shopping preference, data about your menstrual cycle, ovulation patterns, and pregnancy intentions reveals deeply private aspects of your life -- information that, in the wrong hands, can be used to make inferences about your health decisions, family planning, and personal beliefs.</p>
        <p>In recent years, concerns about reproductive health privacy have intensified. Data collected by fertility tracking apps has been subpoenaed by law enforcement, shared with data brokers, and used in ways that users never anticipated when they first entered their cycle dates. For individuals in regions where reproductive healthcare access is restricted, this kind of data exposure can carry real and serious consequences.</p>
        <p>This is precisely why we built our ovulation calculator to process everything locally in your browser. By never transmitting your fertility data to a server, we eliminate the risk of that data being stored, breached, sold, or subpoenaed. There is no database of your cycle information for anyone to access -- not us, not advertisers, not third parties, and not government agencies.</p>

        <div class="info-banner">
          <p><strong>Our commitment:</strong> Your menstrual cycle dates, ovulation estimates, and fertile window calculations never leave your device. We cannot share what we do not have.</p>
        </div>

        <p>If you would like to learn more about the broader landscape of reproductive health privacy and digital rights, the Electronic Frontier Foundation provides extensive coverage of these issues. Visit the <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/reproductive-health-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="external-link">EFF's Reproductive Health Privacy resource page</a> for in-depth analysis, policy updates, and practical guidance on protecting your data.</p>

        <h2>How to Protect Your Fertility Data Online</h2>

              <p class="icon-info-desc">When searching for fertility-related topics, use your browser's private or incognito mode. This prevents your search history and site visits from being saved locally and reduces tracking by third-party cookies. It does not make you invisible online, but it is a meaningful first layer of protection.</p>

              <p class="icon-info-desc">Many popular fertility and period tracking apps require accounts and store your health data on their servers. Before using any app, read its privacy policy carefully. Ask yourself: does this app need to store my data on a remote server, or could it work locally? Consider using tools -- like our calculator -- that keep your data on your device.</p>

              <p class="icon-info-desc">Avoid logging into health or fertility apps using social media accounts (e.g., "Sign in with Facebook" or "Sign in with Google"). This creates a link between your reproductive health data and your social media profile, enabling cross-platform data sharing. Use a dedicated email address for any health-related accounts to maintain separation.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>No. Because all calculations happen locally in your browser, we have no stored fertility data to produce in response to a subpoena, court order, or law enforcement request. There is no database of your cycle dates, ovulation predictions, or fertile window calculations on our servers. This is by design -- we cannot share what we do not have.</p>

              Is HIPAA protecting my data on fertility apps?

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>In most cases, no. <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="external-link">HIPAA</a> only applies to "covered entities" -- healthcare providers, health insurers, and their business associates. Most consumer fertility apps and websites, including ours, are not covered by HIPAA. This means they have fewer legal obligations regarding your health data than many people assume. Some apps may voluntarily follow HIPAA-like practices, but they are not legally required to.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>If our website were to shut down, there would be no impact on your personal data because we don't store it. Unlike apps that hold your health data on their servers (which could be sold, transferred, or left unsecured during a shutdown), our approach means your data exists only on your device during use and disappears when you close the browser tab.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>We do not use browser fingerprinting techniques to identify individual users. If we use analytics services, they may place standard cookies, but these are used for aggregate, anonymous traffic analysis (page views, device types) and cannot be linked to your health data since we don't collect any.
